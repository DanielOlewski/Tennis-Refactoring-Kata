1. Decided to cleanup first: 
	- R#
	- removed unused Game2 and Game3
	- simplified tests
	- changed test data to see if any hardcoded values present + fixed
	- used uint instead of int for ballsWon counter (guards against negative values)
2. Noticed first test(s) only advance the game towards the desired state + then check the display score. Will want to decouple that.
	a. Introduced RawScore, then DisplayScore.Render(…)
3. Refactoring the long Render() + removing duplication. Goal: <5 lines max method length
4. Realized that all code is <5 lines methods now.
5. Small attempt at OCP : made Render() flexible to adding more naming rules in the future without changing the Render() logic
	- wondering if it's worth creating a collection of Rule classes at this point ... ?
6. Added tests for "continues playing after win established" (case accidentlly supported now)

Reflections:
- it was interesting to focus on an aspect like "<5 line methods"
- size was great as an excercise + to compare to other solutions people went after
