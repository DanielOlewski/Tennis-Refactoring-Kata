1. Could not resist simple rename refactorings while adding UTs. Good habit, right?
2. The classes I previously refactored out in Step 1 of the excercise - those were the easiest ones to UT. And yes - they were missing UTs.
	one class really: RawScore. that was the only extracted class that I wrote some new/dedicated UTs for back in Step 1. And now more in Step2.
3. TennisGame tests added. 
	Discovered a few good missed cases (same player name, unknown player, invalid/empty/null player name).
	Added UTs & validation for player names passed in to the constructor & to the methods. 
	Realizing this is a candidate to decouple into Player class: would mean the validation could move there. Didn't see value in that before, bu tnow I do. Essentially WholeValue pattern.
